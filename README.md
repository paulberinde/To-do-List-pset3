ToDo List App

Implementation of a ToDo List App that utilizes SQLite to store the given tasks. App supports screen Rotation and updates ListView after each Entry.
Delete feature not implemented due to  being unable to create a listener in MainActivity (this is due to the fact that MainActivity extends AppCompat activity; it would have been easier if it extended List activity insted);
